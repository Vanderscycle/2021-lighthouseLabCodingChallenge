    "Dot's neighbour said that he only likes wine from Stellenbosch, Bordeaux, and the Okanagan Valley, and that the sulfates can't be that high. The problem is, Dot can't really afford to spend tons of money on the wine. Dot's conditions for searching for wine are:\n",

    "The price has to be less than $20.\n",

    "1. Where is Stellenbosch, anyway? How many wines from Stellenbosch are there in the entire dataset?\n",
    "2. After filtering with the 2 conditions, what is the average price of wine from the Bordeaux region?\n",
