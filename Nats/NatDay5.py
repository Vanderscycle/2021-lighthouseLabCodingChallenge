#Challenge
#Dot's okay with paying a bit of a surplus for convenience, but they don't want to go broke 
# buying dustpans and glass cleaner. Help them figure out which items cost over 10% more at the 
# nearby store, so they can avoid buying these items.
#Using Python, develop a list of items that are too expensive for Dot to purchase 
# at the nearby store
#! better solution because doing it manually is prone to errors
